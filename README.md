AP Computer Science A : Fall 2019 : Quarter 2: Homefun Deadline: Tuesday, November 19, 2019 (end of the day) Every week day late will incur a 10% late penalty per day for a maximum of 30% late.

Students will write a program called Fibonacci. In the Fibonacci program, the student will code four methods: a) int[] createFibonacci(int n): a method that returns an array of the first n (n>5) terms of the fibonacci sequence b) void printFibonacci(int[] a, int k): a method that prints the first k (k<n) terms of a fibonnacci sequence of the array a c) double[] goldenratio(int[] a, int k): a method that returns an array of the first k ratios of consective fibonacci numbers in array a d) int compareSum(int[] a, int k) : a method that compare the F0 + F1 + F2 + F3 + ... + Fk to F(k+2) - 1 and returns their differenc. note: 2<k3

Points will be given for given for accuracy, completion, documentation, and following instructions. Feel free to create a main method that tests each of the methods to make sure they work correctly. Do not include the tester method when you submit the code.
